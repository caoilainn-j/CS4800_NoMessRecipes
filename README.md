# No Mess Recipes
Fullstack web application aimed to minimize the extra "fluff" of many baking and cooking blogs and webpages, taking users directly to the ingredients and instructions. Designed as a social media app for hobbyist bakers to get involved and share recipes.

More details to be added soon, but project is intended to be completed by end of May 2026.
